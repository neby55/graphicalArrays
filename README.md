# graphicalArrays
make an ugly (but useful) graphical representation of arrays

# Usage
- clone this repo on your web server
- create a php file in "sources" directory containing only one variable "$data" (should be an array ;))
- on the index, you will see all files in "sources" directory
- click on one
- navigate on the array

# Navigation
- **reset** go to the first index of the current array 
- **prev** go to the previous index of the current array 
- **next** go to the next index of the current array 
- **end** go to the last index of the current array
- **up** go to the parent dimension of the current array
- **down** go to the child dimension of the current value
